# Data structures/algos

## Synopsis

This is just a set of scripts that I've been writing to prepare for technical
interviews. I'm reviewing general data structures and algorithms, so
you'll see things like BFS, DFS, graph-traversal algorithms, sorting algorithms,
etc.

## Running

Each of these scripts can be run as a standard Python 3 script.

    python3 script_name.py

Feel free to submit a PR if you think I could do something better or you spot a
mistake.
